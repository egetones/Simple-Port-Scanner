**A lightweight network discovery tool that detects open ports on a target IP using Python's native `socket` library.**

---

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of my **Information Security** studies to understand the fundamentals of:

* **TCP/IP Connection Logic:** Specifically the mechanics of the 3-way handshake.
* **Socket Programming:** How to interact with network interfaces programmatically.
* **Service Detection:** How services listen on a network and how they can be identified.

## Features

  **Target Scanning:** Scans any specified IPv4 address.
  **Range Support:** Checks common ports or a user-defined range.
  **Timestamps:** Displays the exact time of connection attempts.
  **Reporting:** Identifies and reports open ports and active services.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only.** Use this tool strictly on networks you own or have explicit permission to audit. Unauthorized port scanning is illegal and may be considered a cybercrime. The developer is not responsible for any misuse.
